# EEG_spectral_analysis
EEG signal analysis using Power Spectral Density and Spectrogram in MATLAB

The MATLAB code implementation includes:
  - `analysis.m` and `analysis.mlx` for the experimental adjustment on different parameter settings of the spectral analysis.

The final report was exported to be `spectral_entropy_analysis_report.pdf`.
The data can be retrieved from either the instructions in the `requirement.pdf` or used directly the files: `EEG_lab0.mat` and `EEG_lab0.mat` (for self-measured)
or `sc4002e0.rec` for Sleep EEG from Physionet data bank.
Walkthrough the `requirement.pdf` and `support_doc.pdf` for more information.
